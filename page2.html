    <h1>Procedures & Compensation</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>You must be 18 years old to participate.  If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to complete four tasks (two short surveys, an interactive investment activity, and a video clip).</li>
    <li>The first survey will be a situational preference questionnaire. This will allow us 
    to identify your thinking style. The second task will be to complete an interactive investment activity. You will be asked to make a series of investment decisions during each of 3 to 7 rounds of an online investment activity. One of these rounds one will be selected at random as the round that &ldquo;counts.&rdquo; One of ten pairs of participants will randomly be awarded the dollar amount that is yielded from the round that counts, in the form of AMAZON gift cards (one for each player). The second survey (and final task) is a short exit survey. It is not necessary for you to complete the study in all one sitting, but it is necessary for you to complete the each section in one sitting.</li>
    <li>You may participate only once.  If you participate more than once, then any money earned on these subsequent participations will be forfeited.</li>
    <li>To participate, you must be at least 18 years of age. Prizes cannot be awarded to anyone who is not at least 18 years old.</li>
  </ul>
